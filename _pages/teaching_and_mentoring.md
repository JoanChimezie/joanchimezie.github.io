# Mentoring 

My love for science is deeply connected to my passion for teaching and mentoring, and I strive to create a supportive and engaging learning environment. Whether guiding students in ecology, biochemistry, animal science, cell and molecular biology, or other fields, I focus on making complex concepts accessible and inspiring curiosity. One of the most rewarding aspects of mentoring is the genuine connections I build with my students. They feel comfortable coming to me with questions, challenges, and ideas, knowing that I am always ready to listen, support, and guide them. I take pride in fostering a space where students feel encouraged to explore, make mistakes, and grow in confidence. Watching them develop their skills, pursue their passions, and achieve their goals is one of the most fulfilling parts of my journey as a mentor and educator.

For a detailed overview of the students I have mentored and the research projects I have advised, please refer to my CV. It includes specific names, topics, and contributions of students I have worked with, highlighting their research focus. It also provides insights into the impact of my mentorship, showcasing how I have supported students in developing their skills, pursuing independent research, and achieving their academic and professional goals.
