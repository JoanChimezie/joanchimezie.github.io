# Mentoring 

My love of urban trees is driven by a deep sense of curiosity that was cultivated into a passion for research with guidance from mentors. Through my mentors, I learned how to be curious about the plants surrounding me, ask meaningful questions, and design data-driven research projects. I believe inclusive mentorship and support for students of all backgrounds is the best way that I can promote diversity and inclusion in STEM and help cultivate great scientists. My teaching and mentoring philosophy is rooted in cultivating a sense of wonder and curiosity in my students, inspiring them to use the scientific process in their day-to-day lives, as well as their careers. I had a phenomenal teacher who started each class by asking his students to describe something beautiful they saw that week, then listened carefully and attentively to each student, providing us with the sense that he cared about us, and that his classroom was a safe space to engage and ask questions. As a teacher, I often emulate his practices. When I teach, my hope is to cultivate a sense of wonder in my students, show that I have a stake in their learning and care about each student, and give clear and consistent expectations about how to succeed in my course or research. When leaving my lab or classroom, I hope my students have gained confidence in developing challenging technical skills and applied the scientific process to answer a question they are curious about. To see specific students or projects I have advised, please see my CV.
