# Machine Learning Class Final Project
## 12/05/2023
In my machine learning class at UCLA (ML 205) we were tasked with training a machine learning model using our own data, and publishing the results on our website. I modifed and played with a script that Dr. Jon Ventura and I have been developing to create canopy cover maps with NAIP imagery for urban California. See my project [here.](https://camipawlak.github.io/recently/ML205)
